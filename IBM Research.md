AI Solvers for Constrained Non-Convex Optimization
https://www.zurich.ibm.com/careers/2025_033.html

1. **Why would you like to work at IBM Research - Zurich?**
I am a supporter of open science, open source code, data, and models, and the general availability of knowledge and information. I appreciate IBM's commitment to this cause. I also like that IBM collaborates with other organisations, such as with ESA on Earth Observation projects.

2. **Which are your most important achievements of the past three years?**
My resume contains all my relevant work achievements. But I personally think the following are my most important achievements:

**1. I make good friends.** Over the past three years I have lived in three different countries: the U.S., Singapore, and the UK. In each, I have curated a group of curious and open-minded people of different interest profiles and backgrounds who encourage me to learn about new things and challenge myself. Through my work, Master's and PhD, I made friends who are smarter programmers than me, who learn, experiment, and build crazy things alongside their jobs and coursework. They show me that an inquisitive attitude far outweighs any skill gap. Through personal life and happenstance, I make friends who may or may not work adjacent to tech. They show me that communication is the only barrier that prevents anyone from understanding and resonating with anything. 

**2. I created "tech for public good".** This is coincidentally also the slogan of the government agency that I was working at in Singapore. We all have our takes on how governments should use tax dollars but politics aside, I worked really hard to develop tools that helped public officers better understand citizen sentiments and make sense of unstructured data to make informed decisions. For example, the data processing and visualisation platform that I deployed on our government cloud started as a side-project I worked on from 3-8 PM on Fridays after growing frustrated with how disconnected data science was from decision-making. I am really proud of how I lobbied for funding to deploy my little idea and nudged a behavioural change in how people interact with data.

3. **How did you find out about this career opportunity?**
LinkedIn. I was reading up on what is new in earth observation and came across Benedikt Blumenstiel's new publication on TerraMind. Then I saw that he reposted Thomas Brunschwiler's announcement about this opportunity.
