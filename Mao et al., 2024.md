- three types of energy storage systems
    - mechanical
    - electrochemical
    - electromagnetic
- each type has unique characteristics
    - power
    - installed capacity
    - response time
    - life span
    - cost

- multi-timescale dynamics of energy storage system differs from traditional synchronous generators
- results in challenges for accurate and efficient simulation of power system with multiple energy storage systems
