## Markets
1. https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/2/28/market-size
	- questions to answer:
		- how much better and cheaper can it be?
		- who would want to buy it now?
		- who will buy it once it is better and cheaper?
		- how might it be used?
	- easier to predict cheaper and better than is it to predict change in behavior
	- pricing is only one dynamic
		- once it falls below a certain level it stops mattering
	- need a theory to why more and more people will care
	- who will care if it is cheap?
		- similar products of products to compete with
		- something that can act as a proxy for how people might look at what you are making
		- Moore's Law takes care of 'having the money'
	- entering the market in which top line dynamics are mostly fixed but there is scope to change things
		- Apple reinvented what a phone was
2. https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-founders-guide-to-understanding-investors-4f99eafe2273
	- early stage investing = investor providing money in exchange for equity
		- both aim for startup to grow to a large business in 5-7 years
		- early = making a product that people demand, use, and pay for
		- growth = grow in a repeatable and scalable manner
		- public = bring everyday investors to raise capital, increase brand, exit earlier investors
	- earlier = longer wait
		- higher risk, higher reward
		- early stage investors expect to make most of their money on 20-30% of investments
		- power-law distribution
	- angel investors = invest their own money
	- VCs = invest other people's money
		- VCs are bound by investors to only invest if they can achieve contractual agreements
			- ownership %
			- board seat
			- terms to protect downsides
		- probe how investor will help
			- resources save time, money, pain
	- great team + lousy market = market wins
	- lousy team + great market = market wins
	- frame your problem in the biggest way possible
		- include adjacent products you can eventually build once your core product is at scale
		- if market is not at least a $10 Bn opportunity, work on a bigger problem
		- companies with huge returns are in huge markets
		- a rising tide lifts all boats
		- even if a startup doesn't win the market, there can still be good outcomes
	- evaluating market size:
		- market size today matters little; what matters is the market's growth rate and how big it will be in 10 years
		- if market size sounds too far fetched, it likely is; try to think of how big it can be but if you have to think too hard, it's not good
		- room for startup to capture a large share of market; market is structurally set up to support multiple winners or, if it only supports one winner, customers are currently not well served and there is an opportunity to dominate
	- evidence of product market fit
		- need to obsessively focus on making a product that users deeply care about and demand more of
		- identify product / market fit and proactively share any progress with investors, even in early stages
		- PMF = users are desperate for product + demand feels exponential + business model works
		- best test is to see if the product is growing exponentially without marketing
		- signals:
			- invitation / referral rates
			- deposits
			- signed contracts / letters of inent
			- ad hoc internal user projects that mirror product
			- revenue, retention, net promoter score (advanced)
	- crazy / unusual in approach
		- world doesn't believe it yet but a change has just occurred that switched the idea from bad to good
		- discover by tinkering
		- tell me why this idea sounds bad to big companies but is actually good?
		- disruptive technology shift
			- evaluate where the world is at in adopting the technology you are leveraging
			- sell to users when adoption rates are quickly growing
			- proxy for upcoming technology shifts is buzzwords
			- adoption is growing + multi-hour per day level of usage
		- unique got-to-market strategy
			- never to early to think about GTM
			- GTM strategy = verified assumptions on how users find the product in repeatable and scalable manner
			- interesting way to get into the market
			- a way to establish themselves once in the market
			- look for structural disadvantages or barriers that allow your GTM to succeed over competitors
		- unfair competitive advantage
			- build a moat
			- drive initial adoption by making a product so good that it is irresponsible for a user to not use over competition
			- hard to replicate (e.g. IP, network effects, scale) and double down
			- value stack
				- proprietary power = avoids the need to compete
				- product power = achieves PMF
				- business model power = translates innovations into attractive profits
				- company power = prepares for rapid scaling
				- category power = captures value from changing speed
			- disruption theory
				- new-market disruption = target a new set of users and compete on different characteristics
				- low-end disruption = target same set of users are incumbents but offer greatly reduced product at lower price point
	- team
		- obsessive curiosity = constantly seek information about customers to serve them better
			- what information (e.g. books / podcasts) executives learn from, how they engage with it
			- use the information to improve themselves or their business
			- good listeners
			- solve hardest problems that require endless tinkering
			- use your learnings to pivot into a big market that loves the product
			- idea maze
		- bold thinking = visualize yourself in the future as specifically as possible
			- execution ability determines how much potential is realized
			- plan to seize the opportunity
			- magnetism = others are attracted and feel themselves naturally pulled into the work you are doing
			- pitch a narrative of what you want to become; being able to clearly articulate a bold vision is important
		- authenticity = focus on solving a problem of your own deep personal frustration and expertise
			- secret to how users are going to interact with a product
			- indicate domain expertise
			- indicate perseverance
	- willing to fail in pursuit of the best ideas; there is no risk-reward optimization
3. https://blog.eladgil.com/p/markets-are-10x-bigger-than-ever
	- > 3.5 Bn people online
	- ~ 3 Bn people have smartphones
	- WiFi is everywhere
	- more people online + always online = more internet customers + bigger than ever services
	- people spend money where they spend their time
	- online services can grow at a massive rate due to global market access of internet
	- there will be more $1 Bn to $10+ Bn software companies
		- base revenue that a random company can achieve is a few fold higher than just a few years ago
	- there will be more $1+ Bn companies outside of tech clusters
		- true outlier $10 Bn to $100+ Bn companies will still be in tech clusters (Bay Area, Bangalore, Beijing)
	- growth of a company = reflection of market size and ability to scale GTM
		- how many peopel can I reach repeatably?
4. https://review.firstround.com/future-founders-heres-how-to-spot-and-build-in-nonobvious-markets/
	- non-obvious markets can lead to hyper growth but are hard to spot
	- market first, strength of team second
	- use first principles thinking
		- contrarianism is a common current
		- what is the real situation, what are the fundamentals, is this even a correct statement to begin with?
	- to level the playing field, anchor to real-world problems
		- everything stems from spotting the problem
	- crack tough markets by being product- vs customer-centric
		- product-centric can be more effective in tough markets
		- in a crowded market, small product tweaks can sufficiently differentiate
		- areas with growing customer base, underserved, specific segments of an otherwise mature market are being ignored
		- show and get reaction
		- "would you pay for this?" - ensure appetite is there
	- play on the fringe
		- innovation comes from pockets of the population that are just willing to screw around with random stuff
	- new tech
		- proof is in the growth rate
		- what are the smartest people you know doing?
	- looks crowded but isn't
		- size up the competition - strong brand? great team? good ideas with bad implementation?
		- look for structural disadvantages - unfair distribution mechanisms or barriers? large enterprises can integrate and distribute
		- suss out if there is room - winner-take-all or winner-take-most? oligopoly?
		- calculate potential customers - served well? total penetration vs what it should be? actual users vs true potential?
	- seemingly niche
		- too small - can easily turn into a mainstream product; expand upstream / downstream
		- too boring - you or your friends keep building the same internal tools over and over again
		- too high-end - see the bigger picture
		- too personally unfamiliar - diverse perspectives to figure out if an opportunity is niche or appears that way
	- market entry strategy ≠ market disruption strategy
	- first company should have won but messed up or have some other externality screw them over
		- early entrants often get it wrong
		- take a product-centric approach in order to pass up those who entered too early and fumbled
	- sometimes too early
		- need more infrastructure or consumer habits to change
	- products that can be used by an engineer but also people who are just more computer literature than your average person

| Stage    | Progress                                                                       | Size                    | Why raising?                                                 | Amount $ raising | Who leads investment? |

## Ideation
1. https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/ideas-pt-i-where-do-ideas-come-from-58ae761800a
	- day-to-day personal experience may not be the best way to identify problems
		- no founder advantage
		- undifferentiated ideas
		- undifferentiated solutions
	- edge = unfair advantage to solving a problem compared to other founders
		- most valuable skill or area of expertise
		- why you? = greater chance of winning, deep connection to idea; focus on learning how to be an outstanding founder rather than the technology or industry from scratch
		- why now? = existing knowledge about why changes make now the right time
2. https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/ideas-pt-ii-finding-your-edge-8808121b591b
	- what are the things you know that few others know?
	- what can you build that few others can?
	- what unique or rare insights do you have that others don't?
	- technical edge = technologists who want to apply their skills to hard problems, even if they're not sure what the problem is
		- PhD or postdoc or worked in commercial research lab
		- obsessed with a particular technology
		- cutting edge of field and working with world's best researchers and academics
		- love academic career but frustrated by the amount of impact you can have
	- market edge = experience within an industry with insight on how it can be improved
		- non-obvious, surprising
		- could someone outside the industry have guessed this?
		- frustrated by how industry works or by how vertical operates
		- changes have had insufficient impact
	- catalyst = someone who activates and accelerates their co-founder's edge
		- highly motivated
		- skills can unlock others' potential
		- strong communicators
		- good at sales
		- full stack engineers
		- high energy
		- product management skills
3. https://www.alexcrompton.com/blog/2017/05/25/hard-ideas
	- hard ideas = things you'd love to do but which seem impossible
	- tempting ideas = things that might be less exciting but which you can already imagine how to start
	- in the LR, easier to work on hard ideas
	- hard problems are scary but solvable
		- complex industries
		- uncertain futures
		- regulation
		- hardware
		- hard software
		- time
		- money
	- hard problems can explain why a good idea hasn't been done well already
	- pick an idea you'll be glad to work on even if it doesn't work out
	- pick an idea that worth sticking to, even if it's hard
4. https://www.alexcrompton.com/blog/2017/05/26/hard-is-not-defensible
	- defensibility = once you're big / ahead, how will you stay there? what stops other people doing this?
	- hard ≠ defensible
	- math hard = working out new things; hard to come up with, easy to copy
	- bodybuilding hard = intrinsic hardness
		- despite small differences, winner still takes all
		- if its a startup worth starting, eventual payoff must outweigh the hardness
	- hard gets you started
		- unique resource accumulation needed to snowball
5. https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/how-to-pivot-properly-linear-ideation-5be605f37d04
	- pivoting = gathering more data allows you to make better judgement about whether your idea is valuable
		- ideas are not static entity
		- starting point to test, iterate, correct until PMF
		- not as valuable as you thought --> pivot
	- value-destroying pivots
		- moving on to the next idea on the list
		- discard important assets that have been created (knowledge, contacts, technology)
	- positive pivots = linear ideation
		- recognize then capitalize on the assets created through ideation process
		- seek input from customers, gather feedback
		- what can you learn from these interactions that allow you to update and edit your idea?
		- become an expert in a niche problem
## Defensibility
1. https://news.greylock.com/the-new-moats-53f61aeac2d9
	- economies of scale = bigger means more operating leverage which lowers cost
		- SaaS, cloud services
		- keep core engineering relatively flat
	- network effects = each additional user of product accrues more value to every other user
		- messaging apps, social networks, OS
	- deep tech / IP / trade secrets = proprietary software or methods
		- novel solutions to hard technical problems
		- new inventions, processes, techniques
		- patents to protect IP
		- evolve from specific solution to accumulated knowledge or insight into problem / process
	- high switching costs = build stickiness through lack of substitutes, integrations, or entrenched and valuable workflow that customers depend on
	- brand loyalty = each positive interaction strengthens trust
	- old moats can be destroyed
		- platform shifts are technology tidal waves that create openings for new players
		- attack legacy player moats
		- build own defensible moats
	- today, market is favoring full-stack companies
		- application logic
		- middleware
		- databases
	- stack of enterprise systems
		- systems of record (database)
			- customers
			- employees
			- assets
		- systems of engagement = interfaces b/w users and systems of record
			- coexist with several systems of record
			- collect all data that passes through your product
			- over time, become a system of record too
		- systems of intelligence (new moats)
			- typically crosses multiple data sets and systems of record
			- customer-facing applications around customer journey
			- employee-facing applications
			- infrastructure systems (e.g. security, compute, storage, networking, monitoring, management)
			- virtuous cycle of data
2. https://medium.com/point-nine-news/routes-to-defensibility-for-your-ai-startup-2875a1b51d4e
	- projected future cash flows are a proxy for valuation
	- ability to generate profit is a proxy for projected future cash flow
	- moats are a proxy for the ability to generate profits
	- network effect = closed loop
		- winner takes-all dynamic
		- largest player becomes larger than competitors
	- data network effects
		- ML needs data
		- prediction / classification increases in accuracy with more data
	- AI companies move along customer adoption lifecycle
		- earlier adopters are more tolerant to initial bugs or sub-par performance
		- contribute data and feedback to help build better algorithms and acquire later stage customers
	- talent attraction loop = the more data the company owns, the more attractive it is for the data scientist to come and work for the company and the higher the chance of building the best product
	- incumbents have an unfair advantage to ride the AI wave
		- success in AI = data + ML talent + algorithms
		- amount of data per use case on one axis
		- nature of companies addressing use cases (tech VS non-tech)
		- large data + tech company = incumbent advantage is strong when tech companies have data, ML experts, and the right algorithms
		- large data + non-tech company = incumbent advantage still there when companies have sufficient data for generalized ML and algorithms are a commodity
			- data might matter even more than algorithms
			- large companies continuously open source new ML packages, turning algorithms into commodities
		- small data + tech company = incumbent advantage weaker when they need to dedicate significant resources to find innovative ways to gather large enough amount of data
			- startups combine different data sources that large tech companies do not have
			- startups generate additional proprietary data
		- small data + non-tech company = no incumbent advantage as companies have no ML talent and datasets are not large enough for ML work
	- success = data x data + ML talent + algorithm
		- startup with the right ML talent and innovative algorithms has a chance to thrive in a market where data is scarce
		- collect data from many customers
		- harmonize systems of intelligence
			- datasets are complementary assets in value chain
			- startups can partner w/ companies that incumbents will never want to partner with, thereby building complementary assets protecting them from these
			- any company that relies on a single source of non-proprietary data is less defensible than one which combines several ones
			- who makes money with my data? generator, storer, or application builder?
		- owning unique datasets of user generated data
			- build a proprietary dataset that no other incumbents own
## Customer Development
1. https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/the-importance-of-customer-engagement-what-counts-as-engagement-and-the-loi-fallacy-c82fd33ee725
	- best proxy for relevant revenue is customer engagement (listed in decreasing order)
		- paid proof of concept trial
		- unpaid trial with agreed success criteria and agreed route to paid deployment
		- access to sensitive or valuable data
		- in-depth requirements workshops
		- facility tours, invitations to present, free workspace
		- letter of intent
		- email expressing interest
	- customer is in some sense paying for a relationship with you (cash, time, resources)
	- insight into requirements that customer has, exact problem, challenges
2. https://medium.com/@saranormous/is-there-a-pony-in-there-fd5b7723d21e
	- get access to potential customers
		- generate inbound = blog about unique insights on the problem space; host, speak at, attend events
			- where does target customer spend time?
			- what are the most valuable industry conferences?
			- organize meetups for knowledge-sharing by target customers
		- targeted outbound = build target list of companies
			- reach out through LinkedIn, X, email
			- write forwardable email asking for intro to person who should care about the problem
			- ask for feedback on product concept
			- send to everyone
		- target 20-25 potential customers
		- mix of different stakeholders
	- describe the pain
		- create 1-page data sheet + 10-15 slide deck to describe the pain, explain product concept, scope, use-cases
		- slides should ask questions that we are thinking as product creator
	- enrich understanding of the problem
		- don't ask leading Y/N Qs --> broadly ask about challenges, describe a pain that exists and check if they agree
		- determine how important it is to alleviate the pain
		- understand status quo --> how is problem solved or avoided today? what is imperfect, slow, costly? how much spent? what / who will be replaced?
		- interview + observational research
	- define product concept, scope, use cases
		- explain product
		- core 3-5 use cases for it
		- how to get started using it
		- why it is 10x better than existing solutions
		- allow customer to react
		- open-ended Qs:
			- what do they not understand / are they skeptical of?
			- how do they wish it worked differently?
			- what's the first way they would use this?
			- what needs do they have? (implementation, integration, cadence)
			- what blockers do they forsee?
			- how often could they see using this?
			- how / when do they decide to keep paying?
		- desired outcome = differentiated product + customer pull + customer understand + addressable blockers
	- plan company strategy
		- what existing vendor?
		- closest existing product category?
		- drivers and drags for adoption?
	- use the data
		- process reactions, integrate feedback
		- go back to willing customers regularly and update them on what has evolved in thinking
		- A/B test messaging
		- share roadmap
## Mindset
1. https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/preparing-to-be-a-founder-7a1740009ebb
	- mindset > skills
		- long-termism = what can you spend a decade on?
		- growth mindset = people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work; take more risk, learn faster
		- competitiveness = race against time to prove that you're creating something valuable before you run out of money or willpower
		- personal exceptionalism = odds of success are low but you believe that conditional on being you, odds are better
		- honey badgerness = expand out of comfort zone
	- no competitors is perhaps not a good thing
2. https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-first/why-knowing-you-are-the-exception-to-the-rule-matters-e817612f0f09
	- focus on realizing potential, not on avoiding failure
	- take on insane goals
	- break the rules (lateral thinking)
	- be resilient
	- push yourself, get feedback
	- be focused
3. https://paulgraham.com/relres.html
	- relentlessly resourceful
## De-risking
1. https://www.codingvc.com/p/how-to-de-risk-a-startup
	- address the biggest risks as quickly and thoroughly as possible
	- show > tell
		- you think you can do --> done in the past --> currently doing it and doing it well
	- external validation > personal opinion
		- claim X --> people affiliated w/ you also claim X --> people completely unaffiliated with you also claim X
	- more data is better
	- PMF risk = prove that you're actually building something that people want
	- product quality risk = prove that you can build a great, high-quality product
	- team risk = prove that you assembled a great team for the vision
	- recruiting risk = prove that you will grow your team effectively
	- sales risk = prove that your team can sell effectively
	- market risk = prove that if you execute well, you can make enough money to become a huge company ($1+ Bn exit potential)
	- funding risk = prove that you have enough capital to reach milestones needed to raise money on better turns or viable backup plan
	- short-term competition risk = prove that you're differentiated from existing players
	- long-term competition risk = prove that as others try to copy, you will maintain strong position
2. https://www.codingvc.com/p/startups-are-risk-bundles
	- can founders work well together?
	- do founders have complementary skills to realize vision?
	- can team build great product?
	- can team find PMF?
	- can founders manage growing teams of people?
	- will target customers be willing to pay healthy price for product?
	- is sales cofounder good enough at selling?
	- if startup takes off, will others just copy?
	- will churn be manageable?
	- if company fundable by investors?
	- can customers be acquired profitably?
	- are there enough potential customers to generate 100s of Mns in annual revenue?
	- spend resources on major risks
	- fundraise when traction is great or when you're about to do something that might make traction great
3. http://seedcamp.com/views/growth-and-traction-for-fundraising/
	- storytelling
		- look at my amazing team
		- look at my amazing product in an amazing market
		- look at my amazing investors
		- look at my amazing growth (non-monetized)
		- look at my amazing growth (monetized)
