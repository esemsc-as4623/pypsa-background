Key points from critique:

Chapter 1
- OSeMOSYS-PyPSA comparison is not new
- translation layer is naïve and destroys the features of network flow VS commodity flow mathematical objects
	- "The divergence you observe will be an artifact of your own simplification, not of model design philosophy. Your conclusions will be circular."
- model attribution is still important
	- methodology chapter with explainability tools (e.g. SHAP, ablation, sensitivity)

Chapter 2
