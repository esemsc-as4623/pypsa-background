recommendation: spatio-temporal resolution should be automated where structural parameters can be modified b/w scenarios like other parametrical inputs (e.g. cost parameters)

spatial resolution
- high influence on distribution line's expansion
- moderate impact on total cost and renewable electricity production
- low resolution model can be used where study area has homogenous energy potential

temporal resolution
- generally more important, possibly due to
	- averaging leads to one time slice resolution having lower peak than the high resolution
	- peak is the controlling variable for capacity requirements, upon which capital cost is based
- need proper representation of the demand peak
	- temporal clustering
	- heuristic methods
	- add peak parameter to secure overall peak of the system
