- waves and tidal can be temporally and spatially offset from other variable renewables (e.g. solar, wind)
	- ocean energy profiles are more consistent
	- tidal range not considered
- framework to quantify potential benefit of including higher proportions of ocean energy within energy system
- economic dispatch model
	- model hourly supply-demand matching for range of sensitivity runs
	- adjust proportion of ocean energy within generation mix
- scenario:
	- 2030 case study of Great Britain
	- installed wave or tidal stream capacities from 100 MW to 10 GW
- findings: ocean energy
	- increases renewable dispatch
	- reduces dispatch costs
	- reduces generation required from fossil fuels
	- reduces system carbon emissions
	- reduces price volatility
	- captures higher market prices

gaps in literature filled
- dispatch modelling of hourly power system operation for scenarios including wave and tidal deployments
- temporally detailed profiles for spatially diverse sites for wave and tidal generation
- framework to investigate power system benefits associated with hourly offsetting of variable renewable generation profiles
- quantify impact of wave and tidal deployments

model inputs
- historical timeseries of demand and variable renewable availability
- scaling factors for future energy scenario demand
