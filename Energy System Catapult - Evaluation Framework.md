reasonable causal claim of contribution justified when
- reasoned theory of change for intervention
- key assumptions around why the intervention is expected to work make sense, plausible, supported by evidence, agreed on by key players
- evidence that expected results occurred
- other influencing factors have been assessed and shown not to have made overwhelming contribution

mixed-methods approach = combine data sources + analytical techniques
difference-in-differences analysis

unintended effects
- positive
	- well-being and distributional benefits
	- driving innovation and decarbonizing adjacent sectors
	- R&D knowledge transfer and high-tech skills benefits
	- developing the wider Net Zero economy
- negative
	- displacement = positive outcomes offset by a negative outcome elsewhere
	- substitution = effects of intervention on a particular group only realized at the expense of other groups
	- leakage = policy benefits others outside of target group
	- rebound effects = transfer savings in ways that offset the benefits
	- negative externalities = costs resulting from activity that are imposed on third parties
	- social equity considerations = positive outcomes and impacts are not accessible to all parts of society
