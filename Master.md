# Definitions
- ***model predictive control*** = control algorithm that utilizes model predictions to optimize performance through model prediction, rolling optimization, and feedback correction, allowing for effective management of uncertainties in dynamic systems
- methodologies
	- ***optimization*** = determine the system that is optimal according to a metric
	- ***equilibrium*** = determine the system as a result of interacting balanced components (cannot be validated)
	- ***simulation*** = determine the system given some rules (often bottom-up)
- uncertainty
	- ***deterministic optimization*** (perfect foresight) = all future states (exogenous parameters) are known at the beginning of the model horizon
	- ***stochastic optimization*** = all future states along an uncertainty tree are known, including probabilities of each branch
	- ***myopic optimization*** (rolling horizon) = decisions in period *y* are taken under some assumptions about the future; move to period *y+1* and repeat, with possibly altered assumptions about subsequent periods (*y+2, ...*)
- event categories
	- transient events
	- disruptive drivers
	- unexpected outcomes
- ***levelized cost of electricity*** = net present value of costs over lifetime divided by total electricity demand; indicator for the cost of one unit of electricity generated by a power plant
- ***load duration curve*** = describes the number of hours in the year that load was greater than or equal to a given level
- ***merit order dispatch rule*** = in order of increasing variable cost, assigns technologies to load blocks of decreasing duration until either all load blocks are satisfied or all generating capacity is exhausted
- ***unit commitment*** = optimization problem where production of a set of generators is coordinated to meet demand at minimum cost; storing energy at scale is difficult and start-up / shut-down timeline requires notice but variation in consumption needs to be met
- ***Markov decision process*** = process to model sequential decision-making under uncertainty (agent makes decisions --> environment responds probabilistically --> outcome depends only on current state (Markov property) --> goal is to maximize cumulative reward over time); can be fully observable (i.e. agent observes true state), partially observable (i.e. agent observes only partial info and maintains belief state), finite/continuous in action space, model-based (i.e. known transition and reward functions solved w/ dynamic programming), or model free (i.e. learn with interaction, e.g. Q-learning, SARSA)
