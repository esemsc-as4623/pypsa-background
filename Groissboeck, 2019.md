unfulfilled functions
- distinguish between hot and cold startups or number of starts per day
- gaseous, liquid, and thermal energy distribution
	- required detailed physical attributes (e.g. temperature, pressure, velocity, and mass flow)
	- currently consider linear and predefined constant loss factors
- advanced or alternative objective functions (e.g. maximizing profit or efficiency)
- short-term budget constraints
- rolling foresight
- limit the use of one fuel at a time
- technology aging and degradation
- environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, relative humidity)
- storage model with state-of-charge, depth-of-discharge
- maintenance planning, planned outages
- time-varying CapEx, OpEx
- risk appetite of investors
- system reliability indicators
