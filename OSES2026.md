Delft, Netherlands
July 8 - 10

- climate science uses ensemble of models with different structures to provide robust projections and honest uncertainty characterization
- ESMs are treated as oracles
	- governments commission modelling studies to determine optimal renewable deployment pathways
	- investors use capacity expansion model outputs to justify multi-billion dollar infrastructure decisions
	- regulators cite model results when setting carbon prices or capacity market parameters
- to what extent are our conclusions artifacts of modelling choices rather than genuine insights about energy systems
- parameter uncertainty VS model uncertainty
	- approaches to parameter uncertainty = sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo, scenario analysis
	- model uncertainty = recognizing that multiple valid framings exist and their disagreement is informative
- propose a methodology for empirically quantifying model-attributable uncertainty and distinguishing robust insights from modelling artifacts
	- technical harmonization -- parameter mappings VS post-processing adjustments to reconcile outputs
	- structural sensitivity -- which modelling choices produce economically meaningful differences in which contexts to inform model selection
	- decision-making under model uncertainty -- for a given policy question, distinguish conclusions that are robust from those that are formulation-dependent
- distinguish structural disagreement from implementation disagreement
	- structural disagreement = different models representing different plausible framings of the problem
	- implementation disagreement = different models making different implicit assumptions that could in principle be harmonized (via parameter mappings and post-processing adjustments)
- develop more rigorous practices for what depends on modelling choices we might reasonably have made differently

- sources of model divergence
	- economic
		- salvage value treatment to credit residual asset value
		- intra-period discounting to operational expenditures
		- fixed operating costs
		- depreciation method and capital recovery / allocation across investment periods
	- temporal
		- discrete decision points for lumpy investment decisions
	- supply
		- unit commitment and operational constraints
	- topological
		- transmission modelling and electrical network physics
		- reactive power flows and voltage constraints
	- policy
		- reserve margins
		- renewable energy targets
		- emission constraints and propagation of emissions prices to marginal costs
