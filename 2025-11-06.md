wake modelling in PyPSA
mainly PyPSA-EUR

my asks:
- GitHub repo
- relevant papers that motivated Ellyess' research

why PyPSA-EUR
- second supervisor does environmental policy, recommended
- Matt connected Ellyess to someone working on it
- spoke to someone who started PyPSA-Earth
- easy to PR and add features

wind data
- performed on North Sea
- validating on larger PyPSA-EUR
- not applying wake effect to onshore
