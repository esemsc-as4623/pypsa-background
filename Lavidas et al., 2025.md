marine renewables modelled in terms of:
- power estimations
- deployment strategies
- revised packing density

higher spatio-temporal data impacts estimates
- reduce energy storage by 73%
- reduce wind installation capacity by 50%
- reduce system costs by 40%
- matches production to demand
- reduces curtailment up to 60%

instances where solutions derived by ESMs are cost effective but not materially effective
- e.g. lithium extraction limits for solar PV

drawbacks of lower fidelity grid models
- ignore congestion
- ignore capacity transmissions
- ignore curtailments
- ignore connectivity issues
- lead to non-realistic energy mixes

generators in this study
- wave energy converters
- floating wind
- tidal energy
- floating solar
