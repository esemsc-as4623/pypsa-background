1. ML/optimization for dynamic installment recommendation, beyond the threshold-based method (proprietary data)
	- data quality estimate?
	- data cleaning timeline estimate?
	- is this just optimization or ML?
		- this depends on the data
	- how to validate / backtest? (this is imp)
		- might need to come up with a custom framework to do this as it's not just train-test split and you need to somehow come up with a counterfactual (i.e. if they used your method in the past, where would they be now c.f. their current baseline)
2. demand forecasting for pole mounted transformers (smart meter data + XGBoost model)
	- deep learning opportunity
	- is the data of sufficiently high quality or resolution to support transformers?
	- you can layer on complexity in architectures
	- interesting to explore the latent space, explainability, defensibility, etc
	- a more traditional "good science, good research" idea with real world impact and in a new terrain
