comparison and benchmarking b/w models
- PyPSA + OSeMOSYS

long-term capacity expansion + short-term dispatch optimization
- is this what TransitionZero is doing?
- double-check

Energy System Catapult
- what model are they pushing?
	- ESME
- can we get buy-in on this comparison study?
- Danny will connect us

Open Energy Transition
- Danny spoke to them as well
- specifically interested in input data, in the context of tidal energy
- the resource is less understood

IWES = Integrated Whole-Energy System
- Danny Pudjianto (Imperial)

Supergen report
- make conclusions on the impact of tidal
- can we achieve something close to it without including tidal?
- if you reduce the cost of tidal, how much more tidal does the capacity expansion model suggest to incorporate
	- system cost reduction is often very small
	- alludes to MGA

work towards an intermediate setup
- maybe 37 node simplified PyPSA-EUR setup
- findings from the comparison can inform what model to compare next
- interesting results = start a workshop to do a community-sourced comparison exercise
