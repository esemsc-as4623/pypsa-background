Energy System Models (ESMs)
- have different modes
    - dispatch model
    - capacity expansion
- output is an optimization
    - difficult to differentiate
- integration of renewables
- complex system with coupled components
    - each with a simplified representation
- analogy to climate and COVID models?
    - uncertainty in the output is as bad as the weakest simplified representation
    - there is QA for safety critical systems
    - is output variability a function of alternative representation or bugs?
    - is the direction of variability systematic or significant?

*nobody has asked:*
*can we trust the models?*
*to what degree do they give the same answer?*

**Sensitivity Studies**
- how they have been developed
- how they have been calibrated

**Mathematical Theory**
- to perturb a modelling framework with synthetic black swan events
e.g. Russian invasion of Ukraine, tsunami --> Fukushima --> Germany stops nuclear
- time-scale
- magnitude
- direction is not important
