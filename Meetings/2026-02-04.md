(with Ale & Ken)

Main thread: **robustness & validation in energy system modelling**
- Chapter 1: how different models have different underlying designs and assumptions that cause a divergence in the recommendation
- Chapter 2: the (in)ability of current models to simulate black swan events and a framework for how to do so
- Chapter 3: a best practices guide on simulation and validation?
	- given that we can't trust anything, what next? (Annika: Black Hole)

Other interesting things
- need a way to measure (dis)similarity of model outputs
	- configuration
	- investments
	- capacities
- is there a way to revisit old investment decisions and evaluate their success VS sunk cost?
	- need to deduplicate / the effect of conditional decisions (e.g. built X because Y already exists)
	- a framework for counterfactual modelling from economics?
- in the wake of grid unreliability, individual consumers are installing their own solutions (e.g. solar panels)
	- what does this mean for the global optimization?
