(with Ale & Ken)

Main thread: **robustness & validation in energy system modelling**
- Chapter 1: how different models have different underlying designs and assumptions that cause a divergence in the recommendation
- Chapter 2: a critique of the perfect foresight assumption and using Markov Decision Processes to simulate decision making under uncertainty
	- can we learn (explainable/defensible) policies instead of deterministic actions?
- Chapter 3: stress testing MDP to simulate the effect of black swan events on the system

Other interesting things
- need a way to measure (dis)similarity of model outputs
	- configuration
	- investments
	- capacities
- is there a way to revisit old investment decisions and evaluate their success VS sunk cost?
	- need to deduplicate / the effect of conditional decisions (e.g. built X because Y already exists)
	- a framework for counterfactual modelling from economics?
- in the wake of grid unreliability, individual consumers are installing their own solutions (e.g. solar panels)
	- what does this mean for the global optimization?
