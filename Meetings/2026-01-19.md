Danny Coles talk for READY

Tidal
- capacity factor 0.2-0.4
	- turbine reliability
	- actual tide itself
- resource assessments: ambient < theoretical < technical < practical
	- theoretical = upper bound energy extraction (compare b/w sites)
	- technical = portion that can be captured using a specific technology
	- practical = portion that can be captured after all the constraints / externalities
- scale
	- turbine: downstream not in wake
	- region: path of least resistance (reduction of flow)
	- array: redirection of path due to resistance (change of flow)
- theft = reduction in energy available to downstream turbine farm due to wake effect caused by upstream farm
- reliability
	- spring / neap cycle
	- weather independent
	- distinct periodicity (e.g. 4 power periods per day in the UK)
- effects of adding tidal to the system
	- low storage needs
	- renewables during low wind periods
	- less gas peaking
