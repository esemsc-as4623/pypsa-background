**Comparing Capacity Expansion Model Frameworks for Offshore Wind and Storage Investment Decisions: A PyPSA-OSeMOSYS Translation and Benchmarking Study**

Tasks:
[x] PyPSA-OSeMOSYS translation for basic generators
[x] Comparison framework for cost accounting (+ reconcile the differences)
[x] Comparison framework for capacity and dispatch (+ reconcile the differences)
[. ] PyPSA-OSeMOSYS translation for storage
[. ] Extend `simple.ipynb` to include storage
[. ] Modularized code (in `pyoscomp/`) for fast reproducibility of scenarios
[. ] Running of multiple simulations
[. ] Sensitivity analysis
(ambitious)
[. ] Real-world data validation with actual offshore projects (Danny's datasets?)

Structure:
- introduction
	- growing importance of offshore wind + storage combination for energy transition
	- investment decisions rely on capacity expansion models
	- different frameworks preferred by different stakeholders
	- RQ: do different modelling frameworks lead to different investment recommendations for offshore energy systems?
	- contribution: first systematic translation and comparison for offshore applications
	- *note: this is mainly a methodology paper using offshore case study as a representative example of how to run the comparison*
- background
	- overview of OSeMOSYS
		- LP, NPV-based cost (is it economists or policy-makers who prefer this accounting?)
		- used for coarse national/regional planning
	- overview of PyPSA
		- Python-based, object-oriented, annualized cost accounting (is it energy system operators who prefer this accounting?)
		- used in academia and industry
	- structural differences (so far)
		- cost accounting (NPV VS annualized)
		- salvage value treatment
		- discounting conventions
- methodology
	- translation framework
	- handling cost accounting differences
		- annuity conversion
		- salvage value adjustment
		- mid-year discounting
	- validation
		- same units = same physical solution (capacity, dispatch c.f. `simple.ipynb`)
		- objective function differences
- case study design
	- single offshore node (e.g. simplified North Sea hub)
	- technologies
		- offshore wind + variable capacity factor profile
		- battery storage + variable efficiency, duration
		- grid connection (fixed cost)
		- gas backup (reliability comparison)
	- time resolution
		- how many years?
		- how many sub-annual slices?
			- seasons
			- daytypes
			- timebrackets
	- demand
		- onshore demand profile (complexity depends on number of years)
	- scenarios
		- wind only
		- wind + storage
		- wind + storage + carbon price?
- results
	- compare optimal capacity recommendations
		- both models = same wind capacity?
		- both models = same storage capacity?
	- compare economic metrics
		- explainable difference in total system cost?
		- levelized cost of energy
		- storage utilization patterns
	- sensitivity to parameters
		- discount rate impact (amplified NPV VS annualized)
		- asset operational life impact (salvage value significance)
- discussion (**TBD**)
	- model choice matters less for "what to build"
	- model choices matters more for "how much it costs"
		- economic metrics diverge most significantly for long-lived assets in short planning horizons
	- single node = no transmission bottleneck
