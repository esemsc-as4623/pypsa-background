**Comparing Capacity Expansion Model Frameworks for Offshore Wind and Storage Investment Decisions: A PyPSA-OSeMOSYS Translation and Benchmarking Study**

Tasks:
[x] PyPSA-OSeMOSYS translation for basic generators
[x] Comparison framework for cost accounting (+ reconcile the differences)
[x] Comparison framework for capacity and dispatch (+ reconcile the differences)
