- Tidal stream in Academia & Industry
- Shifted to energy systems
- Tidal is predictable, regular, not weather dependent
- 3 year fellowship at Oxford
- PyPSA across the UK
- Simulate capacity expansion and optimization
- Where might tidal be added for system benefits even if it is more expensive
- Quality of data going into models; spatial resolution and how it affects the results

**Simon Warder**
- Wind farm wakes
- Saturation effect -- more farms = more interference
- Tied in with the resolution question
- Dispatch optimization -- generators in place and how they are utilized over time given change in demand
- Capacity expansion -- given certain changes in economics and policy, how might certain generators get phased out; how much storage is needed for variable generators?
- Climate change -- resource datasets can change with climate

Lots of assumptions and simplifications in ESMs
- How you represent the resource (including resolution) impacts results
- Tidal is interesting bc it has non-straightforward system benefits
- Working with Elias (another student) on wind -- resolution VS saturation
	- Want robustness
	- Advice given to decision makers should not be overly sensitive to subjective inputs
	- Discretize the North Sea

Many libraries including PyPSA to do this
- Explicitly incorporate climate change scenarios
- Degree to which they model demand side human behavior
- AC/DC transmission models
- We use PyPSA as an ESM
- At least 3 groups at Imperial developing this from a policy perspective; some developing their own models

Always work towards a deliverable (things with deadlines)

"fit for purpose"; robustness
- Analogues in climate and COVID modelling
- Do what is done in safety critical systems

Legacy code: framework of optimization problem is commercial
- PyPSA is open source
- PyPSA is Python
- PyPSA builds on python-accessible optimization solver
- PyPSA has a community of developers

If you diversify the mix of generators, you are more likely to balance to balance supply with demand
- Rely less on another fossil fuel generator
- Fossil fuels have an associated dispatch cost
- Renewables have dispatch cost of 0
- Rely more on upgrades in transmission system

CapEx / OpEx is a na√Øve way to model
- Cost side: need to incorporate longevity, clean-up

Enhanced LCOE
- Adds more system benefits to LCOE
- Fairer metric for policy decision-making

- With higher spatio-temporal resolution, the model chooses to install less storage and wind
- There is very high dependence on spatio-temporal resolution

**Need to do more abstract sensitivity analyses to prioritize what the important efforts should be**
- Inputs that are subjective or uncertain
- What is the best practice/guidance in the documentation?
- Survey of papers that use PyPSA to find the resolutions of datasets
- Model comparison is sensible

NESO (National Energy System Operator)

Energy System Catapult

Thinking about an internship/secondment

Look at NESO future energy scenarios
- Different scenarios for how the energy system can look

**Have people done comparison or sensitivity test or stated that it is not needed?**
